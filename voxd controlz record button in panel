Create this file in your home directory:

voxd_toggle.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import subprocess

# Sends Ctrl+Z globally — used by Voxd to start/stop recording
subprocess.run(["xdotool", "key", "--clearmodifiers", "ctrl+z"])

-----

chmod +x ~/voxd_toggle.py

------

Create the launcher file:  .local/share/applications/voxd-toggle.desktop

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Voxd Toggle
Exec=/home/USERNAME/voxd_toggle.py
Icon=audio-input-microphone
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;

------
make executable

-----

Install & Add to Panel

run in terminal

update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications

-----

Then:

📌 Menu → search Voxd Toggle
➡ Right-click → Add to Panel

You now have a 1-click recording toggle that keeps cursor focus inside your text editor — no more switching windows or losing paste functionality.


Dependencies

sudo apt install xdotool

Once the app is in your panel you will see a microphone icon which will stop and start recording as if you were clicking on the VOXD Gui

The focus on the text window is not lost and so voxd will paste into your text editor or text box without focus issue.
