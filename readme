Voxd Toggle Button
Start and Stop Voxd Recording From The Panel Without Losing Cursor Focus

Voxd works well, but using Ctrl+Z directly often causes the Voxd window to take focus, minimising the user’s editor and interrupting paste behaviour. This small tool fixes that by providing a clickable button in the panel which sends Ctrl+Z globally, allowing Voxd to start or stop recording while the user remains in the editor. This makes transcription flow smoother with no window switching.

Purpose:
• One-click microphone toggle for Voxd
• Keeps focus in text editor so transcripts paste correctly
• Works even if the Voxd window is minimised
• Lightweight and easy to install
• Good workaround until an official GUI toggle exists

Requirements:
xdotool must be installed. You can install it using:
sudo apt install xdotool

Installation Steps

Create the Python script
Create a file called voxd_toggle.py in your home folder, and paste the following text inside it:

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import subprocess
subprocess.run(["xdotool", "key", "--clearmodifiers", "ctrl+z"])

Save, then make the file executable using:
chmod +x ~/voxd_toggle.py

Create the desktop launcher
Create the following file:
~/.local/share/applications/voxd-toggle.desktop

Paste inside:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Voxd Toggle
Exec=/home/USERNAME/voxd_toggle.py
Icon=audio-input-microphone
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;

Replace USERNAME with your actual Linux username (echo $USER will show it).

Refresh desktop entries using:
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications

Add to Panel
Open Menu
Search for Voxd Toggle
Right-click and choose “Add to Panel”
(Optional) Add to Favourites for quick access

Usage:
Click the panel icon to toggle Voxd recording without changing window focus.
Click again to stop recording and let Voxd paste automatically into the active text field.

Why this exists:
Voxd uses Ctrl+Z to start and stop recording. Sending this shortcut from keyboard or window focus often forces Voxd to foreground, which interrupts typing. A panel button avoids this by emitting the command externally.

Future Enhancements (ideas welcome):
• Cinnamon applet with live recording indicator
• Icon colour change while recording
• Autoinstall script
• Wayland-compatible alternative for xdotool
